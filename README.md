# Secure On-line Payments Using FIDO&reg;
FIDO Web Pay (FWP) is a _universal_, _secure_ and _convenient_ on-line payment authorization scheme.
FWP builds on extending the technology underpinning FIDO2,
with a Web-adapted version of EMV&reg;.

However, unlike EMV, FWP is designed to be usable with _any account-based
payment system_, including the eurozone's SEPA Inst.

FWP implements the W3C PaymentRequest API _in the browser itself_,
making the system appear as a wallet for users, and that without
any need for installing "Apps".
