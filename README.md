# Secure On-line Payments Using FIDO&reg;
FWP is a a _secure_ and _convenient_ on-line payment _authorization_ scheme.
FWP builds on extending the technology underpinning FIDO&nbsp;U2F,
with a Web-adapted version of EMV&reg;.
However, unlike EMV, FWP is usable with _any account-based
payment system_, including the eurozone's SEPA Inst.
The FWP Web interface implements the W3C PaymentRequest API.
