# Secure On-line Payments Using FIDO&reg; and EMV&reg;
FIDO Web Pay (FWP) is a _Universal_, _Secure_ and _Convenient_ on-line payment authorization scheme.
FWP builds on extending the technology underpinning FIDO2,
with a Web-adapted version of EMV.

Through an extension to EMV, FWP can be applied to _any account-based
payment system_, including the eurozone's SEPA Instant.

FWP implements the W3C [PaymentRequest](https://www.w3.org/TR/payment-request/) API _in the browser itself_,
making the system appear as a "Wallet" for users, and that without
installing any "Apps".

_Tokenization_ is an intrinsic part of the client platform, obviating the need for specific tokenization services.
