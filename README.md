# Secure On-line Payments Using FIDO&reg;
This site describes how the technology underpinning FIDO U2F can be augmented 
with a Web-adapted version of EMV&reg; in order to support _Secure_ and _Convenient_ 
on-line payments.  Unlike EMV, the system is usable with any account-based
payment system, including the eurozone's SEPA instant payments.
