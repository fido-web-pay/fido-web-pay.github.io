# Secure On-line Payments Using FIDO&reg;
This site describes how _Secure_ and _Convenient_ on-line payments can be
supported by extending the technology underpinning FIDO U2F
with a Web-adapted version of EMV&reg;.
However, unlike EMV, the system is usable with _any account-based
payment system_, including the eurozone's SEPA Inst.
